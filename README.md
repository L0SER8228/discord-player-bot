# Disclaimer (if self-hosted)

- You are not allowed to upload this bot to any bot listing service such as discordbotlist or top.gg.

# Installation

## Before you start

To use the project correctly you will need some tools.

### Node JS

You need Node JS 16.9 or higher version for environment.
Check out the [official site](https://nodejs.org/en) for help with that.
**[Download Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)**

### NPM

You need NPM 7 or higher version to install packages. Luckily NPM comes prebundled with Node JS.
Check out the [official site](https://www.npmjs.com/) for any troubleshooting.

### FFmpeg or Avconv

FFmpeg or Avconv is required for media transcoding. You can get it from [https://ffmpeg.org](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) or by installing it from npm (ffmpeg-static or other binaries are not recommended):

```bash
$ npm i ffmpeg-static
# or
$ npm i @ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg
# or
$ npm i @node-ffmpeg/node-ffmpeg-installer
# or
$ npm i ffmpeg-binaries
```

> Use `FFMPEG_PATH` environment variable to load ffmpeg from custom path.

# Setup

Before start make sure you've done the above process.

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone lakhindarpal/discord-player-bot
```

## Configuration

Open the configuration file located in the root directory. Rename it from `config.json.example` to `config.json`.
And fill every details correctly.

```json
{
  "botDevIds": [],
  "botInviteLink": "",
  "devGuildId": "",
  "logChannelId": "",
  "supportServerLink": ""
}
```

### Here's what it mean

- `botinviteLink`, the invite link that will be used to invite the bot to server.
- `supportServerLink`, the discord support server link.
- `botDevIds`, an array of bot developers user id. Only this users can use devOnly commands (i,e eval command).
- `devGuildId`, the guild id, in which you want to register dev only commands.
- `logChannelId`, a discord text channel id, if you want to log error in discord. Else errors will be logged in console.

### Environment variable (very important)

- For security reason the token is not saved in config file. Add `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in your environment variable. The token of the bot can be obtained from the [Discord Developers](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) section.

## Install dependencies

Install all the packages using npm

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Start

Start the bot using node

```bash
$ node src/index.js
```

# Docker installation

If you prefer docker instead, you can do the following.

1. Fill the `config.json` file
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Enjoy dockerized discord-player-bot
